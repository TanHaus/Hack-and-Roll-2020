Script:
M: That meal was so filling I might get a food coma soon.
J: Oh man, looks like today is going to be unproductive.
M: So how much was it? I’ll eTransfer you.
J: It’s fine. I’ll pay today.
M: Wow, why’s that?
J: You deserve a treat for doing well for your quiz.
M: Thank you!
J: No worries.
M: Do you even have enough money for the rest of the month?
J: Uh- I try to spend less.
M: But I’ve seen you going out frequently with Jay, Sean and the other guy.
J: His name is Peter. 
M: Yeah, him. You’re not working part time too right?
J: Nope. I just use my savings for now. 
M: You might not last long with the way you’re spending, John.
J: Well, what about you? How do you spend?
M: I try to limit my spending on wants, like branded items.
J: Isn’t your wallet and bag is from Yucha?
M: Yeah, but those are birthday gifts from my family. Doesn’t count.
J: What about going out with friends?
M: I do hang out quite often, but I don’t spend much. It’s possible.
J: Interesting. Anyway, I will also need to pay for my hostel and tuition fees.
M: Your parents are not paying for you?
J: I told him I’ll settle them myself first.
M: But you don’t have a lot of money, right?
J: Yeah. I need to reconsider how I spend.
M: You can part-time. Teach tuition. Work F&B. Whatever.
J: I have other commitments in school too.
M: Oh right. Community Service Club and Ultimate Frisbee.
J: I’ll see what I can do then. Time to continue work.
M: Yeah, my assignment is due in 2 days.
J: Same.
